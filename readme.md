# This repository hosts some python scripts for working with the Tableau VizPortal API

All of the code here is heavily influenced by [Mark Jacobson's work](https://viziblydiffrnt.github.io/blog/2017/01/26/documenting-tableau-vizportal-api) which I highly recommend you investigate.

The VizPortal API is (other than Mark's work) undocumented, so be warned: none of this is particularly nice
